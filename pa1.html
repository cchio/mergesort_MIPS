<h1 align=center style='text-align:center'>EE108B - Programming Assignment #1</h1>

<h2 align=center style='text-align:center'>Due: Tuesday, February 12, 2013 </h2>

<h3>Goals:</h3>

<p>This assignment is intended to familiarize you with the SPIM
environment for later assignments and to test your understanding of pointer implementations
and procedure call conventions. </p>

<p>This assignment must be completed individually. You may discuss strategies with other students, but the code you submit should be your own.</p>

<h3>Your task:</h3>

<p>Implement mergesort using the MIPS instruction set outlined
in the SPIM documentation and in lecture.</p>

<p>Look at <a href="mergesort.c">mergesort.c</a> for a C version of the
mergesort routine. Your job is to add the required assembly code to the
skeleton file, <a href="mergesort.s">mergesort.s</a>, such that the assembly
code has the same functionality as the C code. The whole assignment directory can also be copied
to your local directory in corn machines using the following command. To access corn use: <code>ssh yoursunetid@corn.stanford.edu</code>
</p>

<p><code>cp -r /usr/class/ee108b/WWW/pas/pa1 .</code></p>

<p>Comments within mergesort.s clearly specify the functionality that needs to
be added.</p>

<h3>Guidelines:</h3>

<ul type=disc>
 <li>Be sure to follow the procedure call convention detailed
     in Appendix B.6. You may also find Appendix B.9 and B.10 very helpful. </li>
 <li>Make sure that all function
     arguments are passed according to the established convention!</li>
 <li>Follow the register and
     procedure call conventions (i.e., which registers are intended for what
     use and the sequence of steps in a procedure call). Appendix B of the
     textbook is a good reference in this respect. Compilers have to follow the
     conventions so you should, too.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Hints:</h3>

<ul type=disc>
 <li>Be sure you have a good
     understanding of how a procedure call works before you attempt to code. </li>
 <li>The assignment is reasonably
     straightforward and shouldn't take too much more than 80 or 90 lines of
     assembly. If you have much more than that then maybe you should look at it
     again. </li>
</ul>

<h3>Requirements:</h3>

<ul type=disc>
 <li>Write a <code>README</code> file containing your name, SUNet ID, and a brief description of anything interesting about your implementation, if you feel it is necessary.</li>
 <li>By 11:59 PM of the due date,
     you should submit a zip archive containing both your <code>mergesort.s</code> and <code>README</code> to the dropbox on CCNet.
     </li>
 <li>The TAs will be testing your code using the SPIM installation that runs on the <b>corn</b> machines. SPIM is available from apt-get and from MacPorts, so feel free to download it and implement your solution on your own computer, but remember that it is <b>your</b> responsibility to make sure that your code runs correctly on the corn machines. </li>
 <li>Add code to your local copy of mergesort.s, but do not change any of the original mergesort.s code, which controls the input prompts and printing the output. If
     you think there's a bug, please email the TAs.
     </li>
 <li>We should be able to run your
     program with the command:</li>
</ul>

<p style='margin-left:.5in'><code>spim -file mergesort.s &lt; inputfile</code></p>

<p style='margin-left:.5in'>where <code>inputfile</code>
is a text file containing integers separated by newlines. The first number in the file
specifies the number of integers in the array to be sorted. The subsequent integers are the
actual array elements. Included with the starter code is a script <a href="test.sh"><code>test.sh</code></a> which will diff the output of your mergesort.s with that of mergesort.c after compiling it with gcc. To use this test script, first enable execute permissions with: </p>

<p style='margin-left:.5in'><code>chmod +x test.sh</code></p>

<p style='margin-left:.5in'>(You should only need to enable execute permissions once.)</p>
<p style='margin-left:.5in'>Then run the script using:</p>
<p style='margin-left:.5in'><code>./test.sh inputfile</code></p>

<p style='margin-left:.5in'>where <code>inputfile</code> is as described above. One test case input file <a href="sampleinput.txt"><code>sampleinput.txt</code></a> is provided for your convenience, but you should construct several of your own test cases.</p>

<h3>Notes on Grading:</h3>

<ul type=disc>
 <li>We will be using an automatic script to grade your submission, so the format
     of your output must exactly match that of the C program.
     (Verify that the output of test.sh is empty for all valid input files.) </li>
 <li>Coding efficiency will not be
     graded (i.e., total number of instructions executed, instructions per loop,
     efficient memory usage, etc.). All we are looking for is functionality.
     However, you should implement your code the same way it is
     implemented in the mergesort.c file; when there is a recursive
     call, you should make a recursive call, when there is dynamically allocated
     memory, you should dynamically allocate memory, etc. Also, use reasonable
     formatting and white space in your code.</li>
 <li>We will use several inputs in addition to the provided sample to grade your submission,
     but they will all have the same format as the sample. We will not try to break your code with
     ridiculous inputs, such as numbers which exceed the range of 32-bit integers or huge lists of numbers that could
     cause your stack and heap to collide.</li>
</ul>

<p>Good luck and happy sorting!</p>
